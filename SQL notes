SQL notes

order you write functions(?)/commands different than order it is executed/logical order

we think:
1. From -What kind of table do I need?
2. Where - which rows is this info from
3. Group by - what collection of info do I need?
4. Aggregation - ''
5. Having - like where, but after a group
6. Window - 
7. Select - which info should I output 
8. Distinct
9. Union - 
10. Order by - what order to display info in

This might be a good order to layout logic for sql whiteboarding questions
